<p>I'm Luke Downing, a web developer based in Derbyshire, England. I've been writing code since 2013, and have learned a lot of things from a lot of people on the way.</p>
<p>The technologies I use every single day include PHP, JS, CSS and HTML. I also dabble in Swift and Kotlin, though I would by no means class myself as a native developer. I love Laravel, Alpine JS, Tailwind CSS and Vue, which I use in nearly every project I set out on.</p>
<p>My favourite part of developing software is that feeling when, perhaps after several refactors and a few too many cups of tea, you find the perfect architecture for the task at hand.</p>
<p>I'm a big proponent of TDD (although I'm no zealot, so don't be scared), clean architecture and love myself a bit of dependency inversion. I also love sharing the things I learn.</p>
<p>I've written a number of OS packages. By far the most popular one is Poser, a little package that makes writing tests in Laravel a cinch. If you've not tried it yet, I encourage you to; it really is worth your time.</p>
<p>I currently work for a digital agency based in the midlands called <a href="https://ricorocks.agency">Ricorocks</a>. We're a small team focused on making the best software possible without any of the gunk and slowdown that appears when a team gets too big for their boots.</p>
<p>This website is my little blank canvas. I'll be posting blogs, videos, ideas and tutorials on here. Feel free to check them out (or don't, you have free will). If you want to reach out and chat code, I'm all ears! You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDowning19">@LukeDowning19</a></p>
<h2>Why is your site so basic?</h2>
<p>Well, first off, this site is certainly not written in Basic (although if you do code in Basic, props to you). However, if you're referring to the style of the site, then my answer to you is quite simple - I want to get content on your screen as quickly as possible. This site loads in less that a second <em>on a 3G connection</em>. Who says simple can't be great?</p>
<p>I'm not here to do fancy things with images or load in crazy libraries. I'm not here to track you or sell you something you don't need. I'm here because its the web, and I can be. This site is all about me, not about what I can make the web do.</p>
