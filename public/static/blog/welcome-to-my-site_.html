    <h2>Hullo!</h2>
<p>It's great to have you here. My name is Luke, as you likely already know, and I'm a software engineer, primarily in web. I have an awesome job, and sometimes I want to share that awesomeness with other people. This site is my means of being able to share that information.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'm busy, sometimes I'm not, so don't expect content every second of every day. However, I'll do my best to post on a semi-regular basis.</p>
<p>What will I be posting about? Laravel, PHP, Vue, Alpine, Javascript, CSS, Tailwind, packages, libraries, how-tos, walkthroughs and event silly ideas I've had. Basically, anything and everything related to my profession.</p>
<p>Feel free to browse around and go crazy. Thank you for visiting my humble virtual abode.</p>
<p>What is your site built with?</p>
<p>Good question (and thanks for asking)! This site is built on Laravel and Statamic. Yes, I could have used plain HTML, but I opted for Statamic for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted to try Statamic</li>
<li>Its my site - I can do whatever I want</li>
<li>I get some extra goodies, like asset management and a nice markdown editor</li>
<li>It gets better over time, without much effort from myself</li>
<li>Some other reasons that slip my mind at this moment</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyhow, I think point #2 is the most important on this list.</p>
<p>I also use TailwindCSS, which I looooove. It takes all the work out of writing and maintaining CSS. I'll probably do a blog post for it at some point. If you haven't used it already, you so should.</p>
<p>Finally, whilst at the time of this writing I haven't included any javascript, if at some point in the future I end up including some, it will likely be Alpine JS. Reactive JS feels so much cleaner than non-reactive JS, but I don't want to include a huge JS script for a blog. Alpine manages to stay beautifully smol whilst giving me all the power I need. Again, if you haven't already, check it out.</p>
